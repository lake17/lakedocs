1. FF set up ping to primary WLC to monitor.

1. VR disconnect one link to primary WLC.

1. FF ensure pings continues. VR to test wireless connectivity on site.
   If it stays stable, reconnect link.

1. Repeat steps 1-3 for the other link to primary WLC.

1. VR to remove both links to primary WLC.

1. FF ensure secondary WLC becomes active.

1. VR to test wireless connectivity on site.

1. VR reconnect links to primary and ensure connectivity.

   Repeat steps 1-4 for new primary WLC.

   Repeat steps 5-8 for new primary WLC.

1. FF shut interface on switchport connecting primary WLC (simulates
   same scenario as steps 5-7).

1. Once secondary becomes primary, reopen ports.

1. VR to test wireless connectivity on site.

1. Repeat steps 9-11 for new primary WLC.

1. VR disconnect HA link between both WLCs.

1. FF ensure both WLCs fall into dual active/active state with primary
   as sole active WLC.

1. VR test wireless connectivity on site.

1. VR reconnect HA link.

1. FF ensure active/standby state is restored.

Rep on site required for the duration of the testing. FF effort is
