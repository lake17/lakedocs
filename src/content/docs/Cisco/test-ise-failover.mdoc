## Admin Nodes

run standard health checks from PAN (primary admin node).

log in to SAN and promote to primary (process takes up to 30 mins).

once process is complete then login to new PAN IP and confirm the
failover has completed

check AD join status - administration > identity management > External identity sources > VR AD, check status is OK. if its not then get the AD join creds and rejoin any nodes that need it

test successful if administration can be done from new PAN.

once tested, complete steps 1-4 to revert back to original setup.

No need for any third party or VR support for this as no user testing is
required, total FF effort 90 -- 120 mins (depending on how quickly the
failover process takes).

## Policy Service Nodes (easy)

Login to either of the PSN's CLI and execute command "application stop
ise", this will stop services on that node so it will not service any
authentications until the service is started again.

Login to PAN and ensure there are successful authentications, all via
the other PSN.

VR users on site to test wired and wireless authentications, FF can test
VPN access.

Once confirmed services are still working, login to the same node and
execute command "application start ise" to restart the ise service (this
may take 10-15 minutes to come back up fully).

Check live logs to confirm authentications are being serviced by noth
nodes again and repeat steps 1-3 on the other PSN.

Will require VR rep on site for the duration of the testing.

Total effort for FF will be around 60 minutes.

## Policy Service Nodes (realistic)

Zensar required to power off one of the PSN VMs

FF engineer to login to PAN and ensure there are successful
authentications, all via the other PSN.

VR users on site to test wired and wireless authentications, FF can test
VPN access.

Once confirmed services are still working, Zensar to power on the VM and
once all services are fully up, FF will need to check the node is
rejoins the deployment and then we can repeat steps 1-3 on the other PSN
VM.

Check live logs to confirm authentications are being serviced by noth
nodes again and repeat steps 1-3 on the other PSN.

Will require Zensar support and VR rep on site for the duration of the
testing.

Total effort for FF will be around 90 minutes (adjusted to include VM
power on time and extra checks).
