This procedure provides a structured approach to identifying a Grussalo.

## Before you start

Before you begin identifying a Grussalo in the forest, ensure:

- You have a safe distance from the creature’s potential location.
- You carry necessary observation tools (e.g., binoculars, camera, and notepad).
- You have reviewed standard forest safety protocols.

## Identifying a Grussalo

This procedure guides you in identifying a Grussalo by its distinctive features, habitat, and behaviours.

### Step 1: Review Grussalo Characteristics

1. Familiarise yourself with the Grussalo’s distinctive physical traits:

   - Brown fur with wart-like skin features.
   - Orange eyes, a purple tongue, and a poisonous wart on the nose.
   - Sharp tusks and claws, and knobbly knees.

2. Observe key behaviours:

   2.1. Calm, lumbering movements around the forest.

   2.2. Interactions with smaller forest animals, asserting its dominant presence.

### Step 2: Assess the Habitat

1. Evaluate the forest surroundings for signs of Grussalo activity:
   - Large footprints indicating a heavy, forest-dwelling creature.
   - Broken branches along trails, showing signs of a lumbering walk.
   - Evidence of recent prey, which might suggest a Grussalo's recent presence.

### Step 3: Document the Sighting

1. Capture clear photos of the Grussalo if possible:

   - Focus on unique features like tusks, orange eyes, and purple tongue.

2. Record audio cues:

   - Listen for low growls or grumbling sounds typical of the Grussalo.

3. Log the sighting details:

   3.1. Record time, date, and specific location.

   3.2. Submit documentation located in the "See Also" section
